# Roadmap

Sequenced so that **every milestone ends with something you can actually run**. No
milestone is "build the service layer." The ordering principle, inherited from POS: the
riskiest and most expensive-to-change decisions get exercised by real code first.

What's riskiest here is not the same as it was there. POS's expensive mistake would have
been a rounding bug in money. Ours would be a **wrong pay multiplier applied to a locked
period** — because that isn't a bug report, it's back-pay and a DOLE complaint. So the
premium-pay matrix gets built as pure functions before a single table exists, and the
engine that applies it doesn't get to touch a period once payroll has consumed it.

## The invariants every milestone is measured against

These are the HRIS equivalents of POS's "money is integer cents." They are stated here
because M1 builds them and M2–M8 are only allowed to consume them.

- **Worked time is integer minutes.** Never decimal hours, in any layer, ever. `7h 20m`
  is `7.333…` and a shift is not a number you may round twice. Wire format is an integer
  with a `_minutes` suffix.
- **Money is integer centavos**, `bigint` / PHP `int`, wire suffix `_cents`. Carried over
  from POS unchanged, including `Money::fraction()` as the one place a centavo can be
  created or destroyed.
- **Pay multipliers are integer basis points.** 200% is `20000`. A multiplier is money's
  co-conspirator; it does not get to be a float either.
- **Punches are append-only.** A correction is a new row in `attendance_adjustments`. The
  raw `attendance_logs` row is never updated and never deleted, because it is the thing
  you show an inspector.
- **All timestamps are `timestamptz`, stored UTC, rendered in the office's timezone.**
  Calendar dates on the wire are `YYYY-MM-DD` strings, never `Date` objects — a punch at
  00:30 Asia/Manila belongs to the 30th, and a browser in another zone must not be able
  to disagree.
- **Art. 82 exemption gates every premium.** Managerial employees and field personnel get
  no overtime, no night differential, no holiday premium, no SIL. Any computation that
  produces a premium without reading `is_art82_exempt` is a bug, and `tests/Arch/` says so.
- **A locked period is immutable.** Once a cutoff closes, the engine refuses to write.
  A late correction becomes a visible adjustment in the next period, never a silent edit
  to paid history.
- **Statutory floors live in code; rates live in the database.** Admins change multipliers
  without a deploy; they cannot configure below the Labor Code minimum, and the write is
  refused at the boundary rather than discovered at payday.

## M0 — Skeleton that boots

- `compose.dev.yml`: `postgres:18-alpine` with a volume and healthcheck, `api`, `web`.
- `backend/`: Laravel 13 (PHP 8.5), Sanctum, Postgres connection, `GET /api/v1/health`.
- The `04-backend-conventions.md` skeleton: `app/Actions`, `app/Domain`,
  `app/Exceptions/Domain` with the `DomainException` base and its render hook, and the
  directory layout. `/api/v1/health` is built **as a real action** — controller → request
  → action → resource — so the very first endpoint sets the shape every later one copies.
- Framework exceptions mapped into the error envelope, and the envelope **closed** rather
  than enumerated: named handlers for validation/401/403/404/405/429, then a catch-all for
  every `HttpExceptionInterface` and — outside debug — every uncaught `Throwable`. POS
  learned the first half the hard way: handling only `DomainException` leaves Laravel's
  default shape leaking through and breaks the one-code-path promise before it's a day
  old. The second half is the same lesson one level up — an enumerated list fails silently
  on the case nobody remembered.
- `phpunit.xml` repointed at **real Postgres**, not the SQLite it ships with. We depend on
  `SELECT … FOR UPDATE`, partial unique indexes, `jsonb`, `timestamptz`, and range
  overlap constraints. A green SQLite suite would actively mislead.
- `tests/Arch/` from day one, not retrofitted: actions never touch HTTP, actions are
  `final`, no `env()` outside `config/` (the rule is the *directory* — stock `config/app.php`
  and `config/database.php` call it constantly and must), `declare(strict_types=1)` everywhere.
- `config/hris.php` with `version`, `currency` (PHP), and `organization_name`, plus
  `AppServiceProvider::assertConfigured()` as the fail-fast boot check. That check also
  enforces the UTC Global Constraint — but the timezone itself is **not** an `hris.php`
  key; it is Laravel's own `config('app.timezone')`, from `APP_TIMEZONE`. Only add a key
  here when the value is genuinely ours. `env()` is never called outside `config/`, which
  an arch test enforces.
- `frontend/web/`: Next.js 16 + React 19 + TS, `/api` rewrite so the browser sees one
  origin and CORS never comes up.
- `git init`, `.gitignore`, `Makefile` — `make help` lists every target: `dev`, `dev-down`,
  `dev-key`, `test`, `test-backend`, `test-web`, `clean`. No `seed` target yet; there is
  nothing to seed until M2 brings tables. CI runs `pest` on the backend and
  `lint` + `test` + `typecheck` + `build` on the web.
- `CLAUDE.md` documenting how to run all of it, pointing at `docs/README.md` as the
  source of truth.

**Done when:** `make dev`, and a browser page that says the API and database are alive.

**HRIS-specific trap to get right here, not later:** set `APP_TIMEZONE=UTC` and put the
display timezone on `offices`. A Laravel app defaulted to `Asia/Manila` will write local
times into `timestamptz` columns and be wrong in a way that only shows up when a second
office opens in another zone — by which point the data is already mixed.

**Status: complete.** Notes from actually building it, for whoever hits the same walls:

- `postgres:18` moved the recommended mount to `/var/lib/postgresql` (not `.../data`);
  mounting the old path makes the container restart-loop on first boot.
- Laravel's `phpunit.xml` ships pointing at in-memory SQLite. Repointed at real
  Postgres per the testing rule — deliberate, not an oversight.
- The framework's own exceptions (404, 405, validation) needed explicit mapping into
  the error envelope; handling only `DomainException` leaves Laravel's default shape
  leaking through, which breaks the one-code-path promise in `03-api.md`.
- `erasableSyntaxOnly` in the Next tsconfig forbids constructor parameter properties.
  `ApiError` declares its fields explicitly because of it.
- `docker compose exec` defaults to root. Against a bind mount that leaves root-owned
  files the host user cannot write; every Makefile `exec` passes `--user`.
- PHPUnit's `<env force="true">` only writes `putenv()`/`$_ENV`, but Laravel resolves
  `env()` through phpdotenv's `ServerConstAdapter` — `$_SERVER` first, first definition
  wins — and PHP's CLI SAPI pre-populates `$_SERVER` from the process environment. A
  testing value therefore needs a mirrored `<server>` entry to beat an ambient one;
  `DB_HOST`/`DB_PORT` are excluded from both blocks because they are the only values
  that legitimately differ between the native and containerized topologies.

## M1 — Time and pay primitives

Before any schema. Pure integer functions, no I/O, no container. This is where the
expensive bugs live and it is the foundation everything else computes on.

- `Minutes` — integer minutes. No float constructor exists; not discouraged, *absent*.
- `Money` — integer centavos, plus `Money::fraction(n, d)` rounding half away from zero,
  as the single rounding primitive. Ported from POS.
- `BasisPoints` — multipliers as integers, with composition (`2.0 × 1.3 × 1.3 × 1.1`)
  done in integer arithmetic through `fraction()` so the compounding order is fixed and
  testable rather than incidental.
- `DayType` — `Ordinary`, `SpecialWorking`, `SpecialNonWorking`, `RegularHoliday`,
  `DoubleRegularHoliday`.
- `PayMultiplier` — the resolver. `(DayType, isRestDay, isOvertime, isNightDiff)` →
  `BasisPoints`. Table-driven, pure, no database.
- `NightDiffSplitter` — splits a worked interval against 22:00–06:00, correctly across
  midnight, returning `Minutes` in and out of the window.
- `PunchPairer` — pure over an ordered list of punch times. Pairs **arbitrary even
  counts**, not just one in/out pair, because meal breaks are configurable per office and
  an explicit-break day is four punches. An odd count is reported as unpaired rather than
  guessed at.
- `MealBreakPolicy` — `Assumed(minutes, appliesOverMinutes)` or `Explicit`. Takes its
  parameters as constructor arguments and never reads config; the office column that
  selects it lands in M2. Both paths are built here so the engine never has to branch on
  a policy it cannot test.
- `OvertimeThreshold` — minutes beyond the scheduled day, given a schedule span.
- `frontend/web/src/lib/duration.ts` and `money.ts` — the browser mirrors.

**Done when:** the whole DOLE premium matrix is a table-driven unit test, green, with zero
database. Every cell pinned by name:

| Scenario | Multiplier |
| --- | --- |
| Ordinary day | 100% |
| Ordinary day, overtime | 125% |
| Rest day | 130% |
| Rest day, overtime | 169% (130% × 130%) |
| Special non-working, worked | 130% |
| Special non-working on rest day | 150% |
| Regular holiday, unworked | 100% |
| Regular holiday, worked | 200% |
| Regular holiday on rest day | 260% |
| Regular holiday on rest day, overtime | 338% (200% × 130% × 130%) |
| Double regular holiday, worked | 300% |
| Double regular holiday on rest day | 390% |
| Any of the above, 22:00–06:00 | × 110% |
| Employee with `is_art82_exempt` | 100%, always |

The last two rows are the ones that get skipped and shouldn't be. Night differential
**compounds on the already-premium rate**, not on base pay — 200% × 130% × 110% = 286%
for holiday overtime at 2am, and getting that wrong underpays quietly for years.

**Why first:** the same reasoning POS used for `Money`. A multiplier bug found here costs
an afternoon. Found after a cutoff closes, it costs a recomputation of every payslip since
the mistake, plus the conversation about why.

**Status: complete.** The whole matrix is a table-driven unit test — 88 unit tests, zero
database, no container booted. What the building actually turned on, for whoever extends
the matrix next:

- The rest-day adjustment is a **lookup table, not a formula.** Special non-working on a
  rest day is a flat **150%**, not 130% × 130% = 169%. Deriving the matrix from a rule is
  the single most likely way to get it wrong; `PayMultiplier::WORKED_BASE` pins every cell
  by hand and a unit test asserts this one is not 169%.
- Night differential **compounds on the already-premium rate**, not on base pay. Holiday
  overtime at 2am is 200% × 130% × 110% = **286%**, not 210%. The night factor is applied
  last and multiplicatively, and getting it wrong underpays quietly for years.
- `PunchPairer` pairs **arbitrary even counts**, because meal breaks are per-office
  configurable and an explicit-break day is four punches. An odd count is reported as
  unpaired, never guessed at.
- `NightDiffSplitter` works in minutes from the business-day start, so the 22:00–06:00
  window simply **recurs every 1440 minutes** and a shift crossing midnight needs no
  special case — and no timezone database inside a value object.
- Art. 82 enforcement is **by mandatory parameter, not an arch test.** `forWorkedTime()`
  and `forUnworkedDay()` take `bool $isArt82Exempt` with no default, so a premium cannot
  be computed without stating the employee's status — see `04-backend-conventions.md`
  rule 7. A required parameter fails to compile when omitted; an arch test only sees that a
  symbol was referenced.

## M2 — Schema, auth, and RBAC

- All migrations from `02-data-model.md`, including partial indexes and check constraints.
  Three tiers as explicit FKs (`organizations` → `offices` → `departments`), never a tree,
  so office scoping stays a plain `WHERE office_id = ?`.
- `employees` with `reports_to_id` (self-FK) and denormalized `organization_id`.
- `employment_records` — effective-dated. `is_art82_exempt`, `employment_type`, and base
  rate change mid-career, and a promotion must not retroactively strip last month's
  overtime.
- Sanctum email/password login with rate limiting.
- `spatie/laravel-permission` **without teams.** Roles answer only *what may this person
  do*. An `hr_admin_offices` pivot answers *over whom*, and is the single source of scope
  truth. See `05-rbac.md` for why POS's per-location teams don't transfer: there, the
  device token made team context unambiguous; here there is no device, so the context
  would come from the user or the request — which is the exact awkwardness POS's design
  eliminated.
- `users.is_system_admin` + `Gate::before`. Not a role. POS proved a global role
  assignment is impossible to express — `model_has_roles.<team_key>` is part of the
  primary key and therefore `NOT NULL`.
- `app/Domain/Scope/EmployeeScope` — returns a **query constraint, not a boolean**, so it
  composes into every index query and there is exactly one place the boundary is defined.
- Policies: `EmployeePolicy`, `RequestPolicy`, `SchedulePolicy`, `HolidayPolicy`,
  `PayRulePolicy`. Each checks the verb via `can()` **and** the subject via `EmployeeScope`.
- `spatie/laravel-activitylog` installed; logging happens inside actions, never in model
  observers — an observer fires for seeders and migrations too, and pollutes the trail HR
  will one day be asked to defend.
- Seeders: one organization, two offices (Manila, Cebu — different enough to catch
  scope leaks), four departments, ~12 employees with a real reporting chain and one
  Art. 82-exempt manager, the 2026 PH holiday set, default `pay_rules` rows, three shift
  templates (regular 8–5, compressed 4×10, night 22:00–06:00).

**Done when:** you can log in, and:

- an employee 404s on another employee,
- a manager sees exactly their direct reports and 404s on a peer's,
- an HR Admin at Manila 404s on a Cebu employee,
- a system admin sees all of it.

**404, not 403.** Telling someone "this exists but isn't yours" leaks the org chart —
which for salary and disciplinary records is itself the disclosure.

## M3 — Vertical slice: punch in, punch out, correct day

The thinnest end-to-end proof, and the milestone where the design language lands. It runs
against M2's *seeded* schedules and holidays; making those admin-editable is M4's job.

- **Design language.** `npx getdesign@latest add ibm` → root `DESIGN.md` (the authority)
  → hand-written `src/styles/carbon.css` `@theme` block. Tokens enter code in exactly one
  place. `--radius: 0px` is the brand.
- Tier-1 `components/ui/*` and tier-2 generics (`DataTable`, `StatusPill`, `EmptyState`,
  `ConfirmDialog`, `SectionHeader`, `FieldRow`, `StatCard`, `AppSidebar`), ported from POS.
- Domain components: `<MonthCalendar>`, `<DayCell>`, `<Duration>`, `<DayTypeTag>`.
- `lib/api.ts` (unwraps `{data}`, throws typed `ApiError` from `{error}`), `lib/keys.ts`
  (the query-key factory — the only place a key string is written), `lib/date.ts`.
- `EnsureIdempotency` middleware, ported from POS. Punches need it from the first day:
  a mobile client on a flaky connection retries, and a double punch is a double day.
- `POST /api/v1/attendance/punch` — self-service, Sanctum-authed, `Idempotency-Key`
  required, records source (`web`) and metadata (IP against the office allowlist).
- `ComputeDailySummary` action → a `daily_attendance_summaries` row carrying the full
  breakdown in integer minutes and basis points, plus `rule_version_id` pinning which
  effective-dated `pay_rules` row produced it.
- `GET /api/v1/me/attendance?month=` and `/me` with the punch card and the calendar.

**Done when:** clock in at 13:00 and out at 23:30 on a seeded regular holiday that falls on
a rest day, and the calendar shows — from a 10h 30m span, less the 1h unpaid meal break —
8h at 260%, then 1h 30m of overtime that is *also* inside the night window and therefore
lands at 371.8% (200% × 130% rest day × 130% overtime × 110% night differential). One
worked day that exercises the entire matrix at once. `scripts/e2e-workday.sh` proves it
end to end.

**Why the design language here and not later:** POS did its UI rework as a separate
milestone after six screens existed, and paid for it — the rework doc is a list of screens
re-skinned. Four screens of debt is cheaper than sixty.

## M4 — Configuration spine

Everything M3 read from seeders becomes admin-editable, per office.

- Holiday calendar CRUD per office per year, with clone-from-previous-year. PH holidays
  are set by **annual presidential proclamation** — the dates move, Eid'l Fitr and Eid'l
  Adha move a lot, and a hardcoded list is wrong by January. This is data, permanently.
- Shift template CRUD; assignment to employee or department with an effective date range;
  per-date override for rest-day swaps and one-off changes. Resolution order is
  override → assignment → office default, and it is one service with one test suite.
- `pay_rules` editor. Effective-dated rows. Writes validated against the statutory floor
  in code — configuring 100% on a regular holiday is refused, not warned about.
- `RecomputeRange` action: explicit, queued, scoped to exactly the affected
  `(employee, date)` pairs. Config changes never silently mutate computed history; they
  enqueue a recompute that is itself audited.
- UI: `/office/holidays`, `/office/schedules`, `/admin/pay-rules`, using `<MonthCalendar>`
  for the third time — the reason it exists.

**Done when:** HR adds August 21 (Ninoy Aquino Day) as a special non-working day for the
Manila office only, recompute runs, affected Manila days flip 100% → 130%, Cebu is
untouched, and the activity log names who did it and when.

## M5 — Requests and approvals

- Leave types configurable per office: paid/unpaid, requires attachment, deducts from
  balance, convertible to cash, max carryover. Seeded with the PH statutory set — SIL
  (5 days after one year, Art. 95), Maternity 105 days (RA 11210), Paternity 7 days
  (RA 8187), Solo Parent 7 days (RA 11861), VAWC 10 days (RA 9262), Magna Carta special
  leave (RA 9710) — plus company VL/SL.
- `leave_ledger`: every credit and debit is a row with a reason. Balances are derived,
  never stored as a mutable number, for the same reason POS made stock a ledger.
- Overtime pre-authorization. The engine pays `min(actual_worked, approved)` and surfaces
  the remainder as **unpaid excess time** — visible, never silently converted to money.
- Attendance adjustments. A punch-in with no punch-out computes as **zero paid hours**,
  flagged `incomplete`; the employee files an adjustment, and an approved adjustment
  creates a correction row that the engine reads alongside — never over — the original.
- **One state machine, three request types.** `draft → submitted → manager_approved →
  hr_approved → approved`, with `rejected` and `cancelled` terminal. A per-type
  `requires_hr_step` flag decides whether step two exists. One `SubmitRequest`,
  `ApproveRequest`, `RejectRequest`; one `<RequestCard>`; one approval queue.
- Optimistic updates, confined to the approval queue — short list, status flip, obvious
  rollback. Everywhere else invalidates by key prefix.
- `/team/approvals` for managers, `/office/approvals` for HR.

**Done when:** an employee forgets to clock out, the day shows zero hours and
`incomplete`, they file an adjustment, their manager approves, HR approves, the day
recomputes to the correct breakdown — and the original punch row is byte-identical to
what it was before. `scripts/e2e-leave-and-ot.sh` proves the leave and OT paths.

## M6 — Cutoffs, locking, and payroll export

The milestone that makes the number defensible.

- `cutoff_periods` per office. Semi-monthly by default (1–15, 16–EOM), which is what
  most PH employers actually run.
- `CloseCutoff` refuses while unresolved exceptions remain — incomplete days, pending
  adjustments on in-period dates. Closing sets the period's summaries to `locked`.
- `ApproveRequest` must `lockForUpdate()` the affected summaries and refuse on a locked
  period; `CloseCutoff` locks the period row first. **This race needs the two-real-
  connections test** `04-backend-conventions.md` demands — a single-process test passes
  whether or not the lock is even there, which makes it worse than no test.
- `ReopenCutoff` exists, requires a reason, and is loudly audited.
- Payroll export: per employee per period, the full earnings breakdown — regular, late,
  undertime, OT, night differential, holiday premium, leave with pay — in integer minutes
  and basis points, with the `rule_version_id` that produced each line.

**Done when:** close a period; an approval on a locked day is refused with a domain error
rather than silently succeeding; the export reconciles line-for-line against the calendar
view; and `make restore-drill`-style, a recompute of a closed period returns byte-identical
numbers.

## M7 — Admin portal and audit

- Organization, office, and department CRUD; the multi-step employee profiler
  (`<Wizard>`); role management; `hr_admin_offices` assignment; activity-log viewer with
  filters by actor, subject, and action.
- **Archive, never delete.** No `DELETE` route anywhere under `/admin/*`, carried over
  from POS — an employment record is a legal document with a retention obligation, not a
  row someone gets to remove.

**Done when:** a company can be configured from an empty database entirely through the
UI, and the audit log shows every step of it.

## M8 — Containerization and production

- `compose.prod.yml`: single FrankenPHP edge, host-routed TLS, no-CORS preserved end to
  end. Production images for API and web.
- Backups with a runnable restore drill.
- CI building images on every PR; all suites green inside the stack via `make test`.

**Done when:** `make prod-up` and `make restore-drill` are both green.

## Deferred

| Item | Trigger that revives it |
| --- | --- |
| **Payroll (gross-to-net)** | The decision to stop paying an external payroll provider. Adds SSS MSC brackets, PhilHealth 5%, Pag-IBIG, TRAIN withholding, 13th month, de minimis, loans, payslips, BIR 1601-C/2316/alphalist. M6's export format is designed to be its input, so this bolts on rather than refactors. |
| **Biometric device ingestion** | The first hardware purchase. The device-agnostic endpoint contract (device registry, token auth, batch payload, idempotency key, clock-skew correction) is specified in `03-api.md` from M3 so no redesign is needed — only a driver. |
| **Mobile app with GPS geofence** | Field staff who can't reach a browser. `offices.geofence_*` columns exist from M2; the offline replay queue is what makes M3's idempotency keys load-bearing. |
| **Rotating shift rosters** | A client with BPO or retail rotating coverage. M4's template model handles fixed, compressed, and night shifts; per-day rostering with swap requests is a module, not a column. |
| **Tenure-based leave accrual** | A leave policy with year-based tiers (12 days at year 1, 15 at year 5). M5's ledger supports it; only the accrual job changes. |
| **Recursive manager scope** | An org chart deep enough that direct reports aren't sufficient. Costs a materialized path on `employees` plus cycle detection, and makes the scope check the most expensive query in the system — which is why it isn't in v1. |
| **Multi-tenancy** | Selling this to a second company. **Expensive to change**, exactly as POS flagged. Revisit early or not at all. |
